Observations over time:
Early era:
	naked eye observations of brightness, elongation, orbital path (ecliptic), retrograde vs prograde motion
	
Galilean era:
	naked eye observations of phase, color, limited details of planets, moons, rings of Saturn
	Galileo's Telescope: 26 mm aperture, 1330 mm focal length; 8x, 14x, and eventually 20x magnification
			angular resolution: ~4"
